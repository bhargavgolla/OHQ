# Oxford Happiness Survey

This is a web application for automation of [Oxford Happiness Survey](http://www.meaningandhappiness.com/oxford-happiness-questionnaire/214/). User has to fill the questionnaire in less than ten minutes and app gives him a score and his mood after interpretating his answers as per rules given in the link.

This was an overnight hack developed for a friend. This uses Google form to store user's answers and has been developed in HTML/CSS, JS and jQuery.

A [countdown plugin](http://keith-wood.name/countdown.html) was used in this project.
